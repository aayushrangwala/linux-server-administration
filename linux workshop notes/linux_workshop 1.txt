	1] for deployment of any product from our pc to the client pc (Conditions:-)

	1. client m/c must be connected to the internet and 
	also to the telnet tools and services
	
	2. if we are client and need to access the server "telnet tools" is needed at the client
	and start the telnet services
	
	3. IP address of the client and server
	to find the IO address of the pc - (windows - itconfig and ifconfig - in linux)
	
	2] Theres also a SSH server works as telnet server but the data
	is not encrypted in telnet and also SSH runs on 22 port as telnet on port 22
	and ftp - 21 port	

	3] for ftp server we required the ftp server on both the side
	4] HTTP srver(WEB server) port - 80 used to deploy or host the website
	
		web browser are used by the client pc to acces the hosted website
   
		@@ if the port no. of web server is not default then the new port no. is to be specified ie.  www.example.com:8000 where 8000 is the new port
	
	5] DHCP server assigns the IP address to the m/c if the request is received.-- dynamically (can be changed)
	and the static IP address is assigned by the Network provider 
		
	@@also the request is generated by the DHCP client
	@@as the m/c is started the request for the IP address is signalled to the net it is been connected
	
	6]every m/c has unique mac address (media access caontrol) hexadecimally coded on nic(network interface card)
		
		@@DHCP server keeps the database of all the mac address, that the IP address had been alloted to the client
		which has a lease period of 7 days and the same IP address is alloted to the client ---time,date,IP, and mac address are recorded by DHCP
	
	7] NFS (network file system) is used for sharing the file system from linux server to the linux client ie NFS server on to the server
	and NFS client on the client pc
	
	8] FILE SYSTEM:- for windows:-  NTFS(new technology file system) and FAT16 or FAT32(file allocation table)
		
		@@NTFS and FAT are differnt in the way they are managed
			-NTFS can occupy the files that are more than 4GB but FAT cant hold more than 4GB
			-Security in NTFS is better than FAT32
			-for Fat file system the partition must be less than 32GB rather in the NTFS theres no limit
	
	9] Mounting is required in linux of any ext HDD in which it first checks the health on some parameters and either performs the self correction
	it wil warn about the problem.
		
		@@we can also manage the mounting count ie on how much count the checkup should be performed
		-file system of linux:
			-EXT2,EXT3,EXT4
	
	10] linux supports the FAT32/16 file system ie can recognise but the vice versa is not true it is responsiblity of KERNEL
	but the redhat doesnt have the module to reognise the ntfs but fedora and ubuntu has
		
		@@but we can add the module ie any new functionality, by downloading it by the command "insmod"-insert module and "rmmod"-remove module
			
		"lsmod"-list of modukes installed 
		

	11] SAMBA server is used to share the file system b/w linux and windows and also the printer 
		
		@@SAMBA uses the SMB protocol for sharing the file system and printer
			-SMB protocol is preinstalled in windows

	12] DNS server 
		-it has the database mapped the m/c name to its ip address
		-2 types 
		-forward mapping (name to IP) and reverse mapping (IP to name)
		-first when the request is generated it goes to the DNS sever and then goes to the requested site
		-BIND --software to configure the DNS server but its to be installed both on the master and slave server(service name-- named)
		-default port no. -53
		-if the requested Ip is not in the local dns server than it is to be informed where it is to be forwarded for ex.bsnl service providers

	13] PACKAGE MANAGEMENT:-
		
		-RPM - redhat package module which manages the RPM(redhat package manager) and DEB(debian package manager)
		-commands in RPM to install and remove--  rpm -ivh (package name), -uvh(update), -e(remove),-qa(list) 
		-additional file in linux is called as "dependencies" 
		-YUM check automatically the dependencies therefore it is BETTER
 
	14] SEVICE MANAGEMENT:-
		
		-processess --foreground(running on the front end of the user) and background(running without the user control ie daemon process)
		-to start or control the services:
					--ex:- service httpd start
					 	chkconfig httpd on
		-but now a single command is made to handle all the processes:
					--systemctl start/status/enable/disable "<server_name>d" (d as suffix)
		-named is a Domain Name System (DNS) server, part of the BIND 9 distribution from ISC.

	@@putty is the utility to connect b/w servers and client
