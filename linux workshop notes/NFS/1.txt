File Systems:

File systems provide a means of organizing data on a storage medium. 
They provide all of the abstraction layers above sectors and cylinders of disks.
There are different types of file systems available for different requirements.
Such as :  Linux/UNIX distribution uses ext2,ext3,ext4,Btrfs
           Windows distribution uses FAT32,NTFS etc.

Distributed File Systems:

One of the first uses of distributed client/server computing was in the realm of distributed file systems. 
In such an environment, there are a number of client machines and one server (or a few).
The server stores the data on its disks, and clients request data through well-formed protocol messages.

This setup allows for easy sharing of data across clients. 
Accessing of a file on one machine (Client 0) and then later use another (Client 2) will have the same
view of the file system.
On the client side there are client applications which requests for accessing of files and directories through the client-side file system and server replies on its server-side file system.

From this simple overview one should get a sense that there are two important pieces of software in a client/server distributed file system: 
			the client-side file system and the file server. 
Together their behavior determines the behavior of the distributed file system. 


Network File System (NFS)

One of the earliest and quite successful distributed systems was developed by Sun Microsystems, and is known as the Sun Network File System(or NFS). 
In defining NFS Sun took an unusual approach, instead of building a closed system, Sun instead developed an open protocol which simply specified the exact message formats that clients and servers would use to communicate.
